 *
 * `ratePerMinute` overrides the default throughput inferred from
 * transport capacity (30/min belt, 120/min pipe). It's required for
 * liquid raws because pumps cap at 60/min (one cycle per second per
 * `msPerRound: 1000`), which is half the pipe capacity. Solid raws
 * via `unloader_1` default to belt capacity (30/min).

/**
 * Source-facility map for raw materials. Adding a new raw requires
 * picking the in-game building that supplies it:
 *   - Solid ore/sand → unloader_1 (Depot Unloader, 0 W, 30/min)
 *   - Most liquids → pump_1 (Fluid Pump, 10 W, 60/min)
 *   - Acid → pump_2 (Acid Resistant Pump Mk II, 20 W, 60/min)
 *
 * `miner_4`'s in-game water consumption for `item_copper_ore` is
 * intentionally NOT modeled — `unloader_1` is the canonical solid
 * pickup point. The player handles ore extraction separately and feeds
 * pre-mined ore into the factory via belt.
 *
 * Phase 1 of the source-facility refactor. Phase 2+ will revisit
 * disposal (excess byproduct routing) once raws have visible costs.
